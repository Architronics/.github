Arxistence started as a fork of SweetHome3D, bringing it into Git. It's vision is to bring every architectural and design dream into existence. Arxistence is still in its early stages — think "Big Bang!!". We will keep you updated through development. In the mean time, read more about our vision below.

## 🔭 The Vision

Arxistence aims to:

- **Modernize Development Practices**: Implement contemporary methodologies, tools, and workflows to enhance code quality and maintainability.
- **Foster Community Collaboration**: Create an inclusive space where developers, designers, and architects can contribute, discuss, and innovate together. We love SH3D's _Plugin Ecosystem_ that already exists and would support this.
- **Ensure Longevity and Relevance**: Adapt Sweet Home 3D to meet the needs of today's users while preserving its core values and functionalities.

### 🚀 The Mission

- **Core Development**: Enhance and maintain the Sweet Home 3D application, ensuring it remains a powerful and user-friendly tool for architects.
- **Plugin Ecosystem**: Develop and support a diverse range of plugins to extend the functionality of Sweet Home 3D.
- **Community Engagement**: Host discussions, provide support, and encourage contributions to the global community.
